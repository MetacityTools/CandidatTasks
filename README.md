## Task

This repo contains data scraped from GoOut.cz, the data is saved as GeoJSON (`out.json`), other information is in the CSV file (`venues.csv`).

Show what data the given files contain, how it is spatially distributed, spatial context (locations around, public transport, etc.), relationships and links...

- Analyze the data.
- **Mandatory - Create a simple visualization web app, use React for the UI and either:**
  - **[three.js](https://threejs.org/) for rendering,**
  - **or [WebGL](https://registry.khronos.org/webgl/specs/latest/2.0/) for rendering.**
- After completing the mandatory task, optionally:
  - use [banana.gl](https://github.com/vojtatom/banana.gl) for rendering,
  - use [deck.gl](https://deck.gl/#/) for rendering,
  - use [mapbox-gl](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) for rendering,
  - use [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) for rendering,
  - use [openlayers](https://openlayers.org/) for rendering,
  - use anything else for rendering.
- use the available GeoJSON of [road network](https://opendata.iprpraha.cz/CUR/DOP/DOP_TSK_UlicUsPAKOM_l/S_JTSK/DOP_TSK_UlicUsPAKOM_l.json) to show the spatial context (download from opendata.iprpraha.cz)

## Output

Interactive web application. Please submit as link to your own github repo with instructions on how to run the app. Keep it simple.
