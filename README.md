## Task

Render and present all data from the GoOut portal on the map of Prague. The data is saved as GeoJSON (`out.json`), other information is in the CSV file (`venues.csv`).

The user wants to know what data the given file contains, how it is spatially distributed, spatial context (locations around, public transport, etc.), relationships and links...

- Analyze the data. It contains a lot of redundancies, clean it (cleaning localy once is enough).
- **Mandatory - Create a simple visualization web app, use [three.js](https://threejs.org/) for rendering and React for the UI.** After completing the mandatory task, optionally:
  - use [banana.gl](https://github.com/vojtatom/banana.gl)
  - use [deck.gl](https://deck.gl/#/) for rendering
  - use [mapbox-gl](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) for rendering
  - use [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) for rendering
  - use [openlayers](https://openlayers.org/) for rendering
  - use anything else for rendering
- Add additional datasets, map background, interactivity, etc.

## Output

Interactive web application.
